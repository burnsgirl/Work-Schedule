Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

For this project I used two new tools, Moment and jQuery. I created a planner that maps out the day in hourly blocks. When the user inputs the data and hits the save button the data is then stored in the local storage on the computer. When the page refreshes, the information is pulled into the schedule upon loading. Depending on the time of day, the scheudle will highlight the past, present, and future time blocks. The past is outlined in grey, the present is red, and the future is green.
